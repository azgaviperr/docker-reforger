## Custom Configuration File

To use a custom configuration file:

1. Start the server once to generate the default configuration file (`docker_generated.json`) in the `configs` directory.
2. Rename and modify this file as needed (e.g., `my_custom_config.json`).
3. Update the `ARMA_CONFIG` environment variable to point to the new file.
4. Restart the server to apply the changes.

## Example `.env` File

Hereâ€™s an example `.env` file for configuring your server:

```env
ARMA_CONFIG=docker_generated.json
GAME_NAME=My Custom Server
GAME_PASSWORD=
GAME_PASSWORD_ADMIN=ChangeMeNow!123
GAME_MAX_PLAYERS=64
GAME_SCENARIO_ID={3DAD390C31623F04}Missions/24_OVT_Eden.conf
SKIP_INSTALL=false
```

## Volumes and Data Persistence

To ensure server files and configurations persist across container restarts, map a host directory to `/reforger` in your Docker Compose or Docker run command:

```yaml
volumes:
    - ./reforger:/reforger
```

For more advanced configuration options, refer to the [Advanced Usage](../advanced-usage/index.md) section.
